# online-voting-spring_flutter


The project is an online voting application that allows users to view candidate details, vote for their preferred candidate, and track real-time results. Users can register, log in, and vote once logged in. Features include user session management, secure authentication, vote storage, and interactive display of results. The application is developed using Flutter for the user interface, firebase for phone authentification and Spring Boot for the backend, with a database to store voter and candidate data.
